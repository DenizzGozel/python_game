    <h1>Welcome to the Overflow Board Game</h1>

    <div class="info-section">
      <h2>Game Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Control the entire board by placing gems and causing them to overflow
        into neighboring cells. If you manage to turn every cell on the board
        into your color, you win!
      </p>

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> On your turn, place a gem on an empty cell or one that already belongs to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Overflow Mechanic:</strong> If the number of gems in a cell reaches the number of the direct neighboors that cell has, the cell overflows and the gems spread to adjacent cells, flipping their ownership to your color.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Opponent:</strong> Our built-in AI will automatically place gems for the opposing player. Keep an eye on its moves!</li>
        <li><strong>Winning Condition:</strong> The game ends when the entire board is controlled by a single color.</li>
      </ol>
